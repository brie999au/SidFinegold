Sydney Finegold was born in Far Rockaway, New York, to parents who were Russian Jews recently immigrated to the U.S.  He experienced  childhood stigma and prejudice around being the skinny little Jewish kid.  He died renowned and revered by several generations of scientists, as a kind and generous mentor and as a giant of a medical scientist.   Indeed, he chose to celebrate  both his 80th and his 90th birthdays, by organizing a conference which hundreds of colleagues around the world attended. He wrote an autobiography in 2011 when he turned 90, which was published in <a href="http://www.autismandbacteria.com/Autobiography.html">The Bulletin of BISMiS</a>

His greatest passions in life were medical research (anaerobic bacteria and their role in illness -- he was among the first to posit a relationship between the gut biome and autism) and clinical medicine (infectious diseases).   His scientific curiosity continued to flourish until poor health forced him to retire fully from research at age 96.</p>
<p> More information on his recent research interest in autism and gut bacteria is available here: <a href="http://www.autismandbacteria.com/index.html">Autism and Bacteria</a>
